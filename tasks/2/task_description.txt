  Task: Implement semantic search to the match with best consultant.

  We currently have consultant matching capabilities in the app, use AI to semantically match the user with a consultant.

  Instructions:

    Goal:
    - Use AI to use semantics to match a user's inquiry with the best consultant.
    - Categorise the user's inquiry according the the consultant's areas of expertise.
    - Match the user with a consultant.

    Constraints:
    - The endpoint must recieve an inquiry.
    - If no inquiry is recieved the route must return a 400 error.
    - The system must use AI to  match the user with a consultant.
    - If the system fails to match the user with a consultant it should fallback to searching through an array.
    - Upon successful matching with a consultant the route should return a 200 status.
    - The status message should be "Successfully matched user with consultant."
    - If the endpoint fails it should return a 500 error.
    - The error message should be "Internal server error.".

    What will be Tested:
    - If no inquiry is present the route should return a 400 error.
    - The error message should say "Error: Missing requirement inquiry".
    - The enpoint must use AI to match the user with a consultant.
    - If the route successfully matches the user with a consultant it should return a 200 status.
    - The status message should be "Successfully matched user with consultant."
    - If the route fails to match the user with a consultant it should return a 500 status.
    - The status message should be "Internal server error".
