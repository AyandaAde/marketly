    Goal:
    - When a user is filling up the inquiry form enable them to add a firstName and lastName. 

    Constraints:

    - The form should throw an error if no firstName or lastName are present in the form.
    - The firstName and LastName should be passed to the backend.
    - The backend should throw an error if no firstName or lastName are present.

    What will be Tested:
    - The system should throw an error if no firstName or lastName are present in the form.
    - If no firstName is passed to the backend it should throw 400 error.
    - The error message should be 'Error: Missing requirement first name.'
    - If no lastName is passed to the backend it should throw 400 error.
    - The error message should be 'Error: Missing requirement last name.'
    - If the route succeeds in sending an email to the consultant it should return a 200 status.
    - If the route fails to send an email to the consultant it should return a 500 status.
