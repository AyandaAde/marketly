  in the cookies.

    Instructions:
    
    Goal:
    - When a cartSessionId sessionId is created it should be saved as cartSessionId in the cookies.
    - It should be saved in the create-cart route.

    - It should be accessed as cartSessionId.

    - If the system in unable to create it it should return a 400 error.
