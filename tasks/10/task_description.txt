  Task: Delete items from the wishlist.

  We currently have wishlist functionality that doesn't allow user's to remove things from their wishlst, enable the program ot allow user's to delete items from their wishlist.

  Instructions:

    Goal:
    - The user should be able to delete things to their wishlist using their userId.
    - The code must update the logic to delete items from the user's wishlist if they are already present in the wishlist.
    - Make a call to the remove-from-wishlist route when a user removes something from their wishlist.
    - Update the frontend to show that the item has been removed from the wishlist.

    Constraints:
    - The system should send the user's userId to the backend.
    - If there is no userId the route should use the user's sessionId. 
    - If no essionId is found the route should throw a 400 error.
    - The system should delete the item from the user's wishlist.
    - The system should update the frontend to show that the item has been removed from the user's wishlist.

    What will be Tested:
    - The system should send the user's userId to the backend.
    - If there is no userId or sessionId in the backend it should return a 400 error.
    - The error message should be "Error: Missing requirement sessionId".
    - The system should delete the wishlistItem.
    - If the system fails to delete the item it should return a 500 error.
    - The error message should be "Internal server error".
    - If the system succeeds it should return a 200 status.
    - The status message should be "Successfully deleted item from wishlist"
