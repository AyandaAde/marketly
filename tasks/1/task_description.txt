  Task: Match with best consultant enhancement.

  We have a match with best consultant feature that currently matches a user to the best consultant for their inquiry. Make it so if a user's inquiry doesn't match any of the 
  consultant's areas of expertise it should categorise it as a general inquiry and match them with the first consultant that matches and return success or error messages upon
  success or failure to match with a consultant.
